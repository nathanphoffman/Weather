The format this outputs is:

Ex1: 70 1
Ex2: 55H 8W
Ex3: 45 25WT

The first number that is provided in the output is the temperature, rounded to the nearest 5, in real-feel temperature. This includes wind, sun (cloud cover), and humidity.

Letters can follow either of the two numbers they indicate as follows:
H = Humid
T = Thunderstorms / Lightning Chance
W = Windy

If the chance and/or severity is high, there may be additional letters like TTT representing a higher chance of strong thunderstorms vs a single T which is a small chance of thunderstorms.

The second number is the "storm factor" lower is always better, a guide is below:

------ 0-4: Great time to be outside (from a storm, or lack there of, perspective)
0: Perfect conditions, little to no wind, absolutely sunny skys, beautiful.
1-2: Great conditions: there might be a tiny bit of cloud cover, or small breeze, but otherwise beautiful
3-4: Good conditions: could have passing cloud cover and/or be breezy but likely also has lengthy periods of sunlight

------ 5-9: Ok time to be outside (from a storm perspective)
5-6: Decent conditions: probably ~50% cloud cover or windy (or some lesser combination of both)
7-9: Lesser conditions: remote chance of rain, but the weather is likely not great: mostly overcast and/or very windy

------ 10+: Not a good time to be outside (from a storm perspective)
10-19: Light storm conditions, light percipitation is possible, it likely looks storm-like outside and is almost entirely (or is completely) overcast.
20-30: Proper storm conditions, precipitation is all but guaranteed, on the upper end could have some real strong winds and thunderstorms as well
30-50: Severe storm conditions, likely heavy down pours and extremely strong winds / thunderstorms, likely very dark
50+: Hurricaine or Bad Blizzard conditions, likely very dark

-------------------------

In an ideal world, you want the temperature to be comfortable for you and the storm factor to be less than 5.
