The format this outputs is:

Ex1: 70 1
Ex2: 55H 8W
Ex3: 45 25WT

The first number that is provided in the output is the temperature, rounded to the nearest 5 (in "realfeel," meaning it is altered by humidity, wind speed, and if it is the sun is shining during the day).

Letters can follow either of the two numbers they indicate as follows:
H = Humid
T = Thunderstorms / Lightning Chance
W = Windy

If the chance and/or severity is high, there may be additional letters like TTT representing a higher chance of strong thunderstorms vs a single T which is a small chance of thunderstorms.

Storm rating
-------------------------
The second number is the "storm factor" lower is always better. The storm factor represents the maximum possible cloud cover in 10% increments so 3 = 30% maximum. 
The number also includes wind and chance of rain/snow, this means numbers >10 indicate precipitation is possible and numbers below 10 it is almost impossible.
If the number is > 20 it is very likely pretty strong storm conditions, rain is extremely likely, and might be accompanied by winds or thunderstorms, or some combination

0 is the best possible storm rating (totally clear, little wind, no chance of precipitation).
Around 100 is the highest possible storm rating, but for this to happen it would have to be some of the worst conditions imaginable (strong thunderstorms + hurricaine or tropical storm winds + heavy rain)



Smiley Faces
------------
In an ideal world, you want the temperature to be comfortable for you and the storm factor to be less than 5 (when this happens a smiley face with glasses shows)

In a slightly less (but still decent scenario) the weather is cool or very warm but with clear skies.  
Or the weather is perfect temperatures with possible wind and modestly cloudy skies. (when this happens a regular smiley shows)
